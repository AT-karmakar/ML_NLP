"Kannada MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification Using Dimensionality Reduction and Machine Learning Models"

The problem focuses on classifying handwritten Kannada digits using machine learning models. It involves utilizing a dataset comprising 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each sized 28x28 pixels. The process involves reducing the dimensions of these images using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to 10 components and then applying various classification models such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, K-NN Classifier, and SVM.

The objective is to evaluate the performance of these models by computing metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, creating Confusion Matrices, and analyzing RoC-AUC curves for each model. Additionally, the experiment aims to be repeated with different component sizes (15, 20, 25, 30) to observe how varying dimensions impact the model performance in classifying the Kannada digits.
